# ==================================================
# YOUR FIRST PYTHON PROGRAM
# ==================================================
# The print() function displays output to the screen.

print("Hello, World!")

# ==================================================
# UNDERSTANDING print()
# ==================================================
# print is a built-in Python function.
# It sends data to the output screen (console).

# The text inside quotes is called a STRING.
# Strings represent textual data.

# ==================================================
# PRINTING MULTIPLE LINES
# ==================================================

print("Learn With Striver")
print("Welcome to LWS – Programming Fundamentals 1001")

# Python executes these lines in order.

# ==================================================
# EXECUTION ORDER
# ==================================================
# Python follows a sequential execution model.
# Code runs from top to bottom.

print("Execution starts")
print("Execution ends")

# ==================================================
# COMMENTS IN PYTHON
# ==================================================
# Comments are used to explain code.
# Python ignores comments during execution.

# Single-line comments start with #

# Writing good comments:
# - Improves readability
# - Helps others understand your code
# - Helps YOU later

# ==================================================
# KEY TAKEAWAYS
# ==================================================
# - Python programs are simple to write
# - print() is used to display output
# - Code executes line by line
# - Comments explain, not execute
